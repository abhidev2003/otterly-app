Welcome to Otterly, a friendly, AI-powered journaling companion designed to make self-reflection effortless and meaningful. With a little help from our mascot, Oto the Otter, users can capture their daily thoughts, receive empathetic AI-generated feedback, and track their personal journey.

This project was built with a beginner-friendly, modern tech stack, focusing on serverless technologies and in-browser machine learning.
